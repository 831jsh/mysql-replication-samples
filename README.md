# mysql-replication-samples
A collection of tools for deploying and testing replication topologies with MySQL and MariaDB

The files in this collection are here to help beginners who want to start using advanced features like multi-source replication and test how they work.
They are based on [MySQL Sandbox](http://mysqlsandbox.net), with the goal that they will be eventually integrated in that project.
